Pitch - A top down interactive space shooter game that player object shoots
bullet towards the enemy to gain score.

Outline - 1. We will use the processing.org library to incorporate the player and the enemy, and all the other objectives will be conducted via this interface.

2. We will commit, push, and pull regularly to let the teammates to know the process that is happening and let them know what to do

3. We will use a database to save data of enemy structure and number of scores.

4. We will have a collection of enemies and when the enemies are hit by a ‘bullet ’of the player, we will delete the enemy from the collection. We will also keep adding enemies in the collection continuously.

5. We will try our best to make the project and finish it with the best result.
